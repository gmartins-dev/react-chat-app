StreamBid front end test

Introduction

The objective of this test is to give us some idea of how you might develop a project.
• You may use any technologies that will solve the problem (Javascript/React/Node.js/Github/Selenium/Jest
etc as you see fit).
• Please state what technologies you use, and the licenses that they are under.
• Put up code and any other artefacts under GitHub. This is so we can see how the project and code develops.
Assignment:
You have been asked to create a demo web chat app. It is to be shown internally to developers and perhaps to
a very few select customers.
• Initially the whole project will run on a single machine in a couple of browsers. We will call the browsers
user1, and user2 for the purpose of this document.
• User1 types some text into a dialog box and presses enter. This appears in a chat log for user1 and user2.
• User 2 types some text presses enter, and we are expecting the same result as user1.
• We need some way of connecting the 2 web chat browsers (ip address, IDs, anything else)
• We need to be able to identify where the messages came from (maybe ID/different colours).
• As long as the users are connected they can keep passing messages back and forth.
• A user can quit and restart.
For the assignment we are expecting three different steps of “development”
• Phase 1 Look through the spec. Create a quick architectural design (you can use draw.io for a quick and easy
graph). Breakdown into sub modules and estimate how long they will take.
• Phase 2 Implement the design as you see-fit. Test it in a reasonable manner.
• Phase 3 document how you might improve the chat app. What would a real customer want, what about
security, multiple users on different machines etc? What effect would this have on you design, if any?
Consider, as we go from demo to real app, several programmers might come onto the project. What processes
could we use to make everybody’s life easier?
Deliverables

1h video call with Federico, Richard, and James where you walk us through your reasoning and methods. We
are very interested in understanding your reasoning process and in why you chose some tech over another.
There is NO 100% right answer. We want to see how you tackle a problem and what ways you choose to solve
it.
If you borrow code from the internet, please make sure to comment it accordingly and include a URL link in
the comment from the source.
We do not expect you to spend more than 5 hours on this, and we will pay between £50-£150 depending on
the completeness & suitability of your solution.
Completion & Payment does not guarantee that you will be successful with your application.
